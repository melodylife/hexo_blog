Sometimes you need to debug frontend codes via your mobile browsers. Here's how

1. Connect your mobile device to your laptop/desktop
1. Enable debug mode on your mobile and authorize your computer on it
1. Open Chrome on your laptop/desktop and input "chrome://inspect"
1. You should now find your device listed out there. Choose it. 
1. Click the "inspect" button under it and you can find the regular debug window open.
1. Request the testing target url on your mobile or request it via inspect window.

##Enjoy
